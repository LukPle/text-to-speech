# Android App Library: Text To Speech

## About
Welcome to our Android application. The app is part of the Open Sorce [Android App Library](https://github.com/LukPle/android-app-library.git) 
and adopts all licensing and community guidelines from this project. Please use the link in order to check out the corresponding repository.

The text-to-speech app showcases a text to speech generator using a **TextToSpeech** instance. The voice output can be modified with user input from a **EditText** field,
**SeekBars** and **RadioButtons**. This serves as an example of this feature.

## Features
The program takes the text and user input of pitch and speed and creates a voice output in the selected language using all those values. 
The app offers two different languages out of the box but other ones can be added. </br>
